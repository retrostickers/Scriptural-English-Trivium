Seg Trivium Canonical
Scriptural English Trivium (SET) - Canonical Reference

Repository Purpose: This repository documents the Scriptural English Trivium (SET), a structured framework for Scripture study and analysis. It formalizes the three interdependent planes of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric as applied to covenant, naming, and seed structures.

1. Overview

SET consists of three planes forming the Trivium:

Grammar (A-plane) – Reveals the structure of truth in language.

Logic (V-plane / Dialectic) – Ensures coherence and alignment.

Rhetoric / Bearing / Witness (Z-plane) – Expresses truth into relational space faithfully.

Together, they preserve covenantal integrity and prevent inverted seed structures from embedding into culture or authority systems.

2. Canonical Table
Plane / Component	Name	Function	Role in Covenant	Key Notes / Example
A-plane	Grammar	Reveals structure of truth in language; establishes what exists and how it is composed	Protects seed and naming from distortion; ensures continuity of promise	Example: “Seed” as relational clause, not mere biological term; correct naming aligns reality with covenant
V-plane	Logic (Dialectic)	Ensures coherence and alignment; verifies continuity, consistency, and relational integrity	Exposes inverted seed, broken continuity, and misalignment; stabilizes covenantal authority	Example: In Genesis, identifying Cain’s inversion versus Abel’s covenant alignment; structural recognition of internal witness versus external deception
Z-plane	Rhetoric / Bearing / Witness	Expresses truth faithfully into relational space; moves internal truth outward without domination	Allows mercy and covenant to manifest in relationship; prevents inverted authority, coercion, or elitism	Example: Christ speaking in parables, Abel’s offering; naming a city under covenantal alignment vs. Cain’s naming of a city under inversion
3. Canonical Notes

Interdependence:

Each plane requires the others to function fully: Grammar → Logic → Rhetoric

Collapse at any plane produces distortion:

Grammar failure → misnaming / false structure

Logic failure → incoherence / inversion accepted as norm

Rhetoric failure → domination, coercion, false authority

Seed and Naming:

Seed is relational continuity, not biology

Naming is A-plane manifestation, always potentially inverted

Proper alignment ensures covenantal seed survives across planes

Failure Modes:

A-plane: Inverted naming, misattribution, seed misidentified

V-plane: Logic collapse, false justification, episodic authority

Z-plane: Domination, coercion, hierarchy, cultural embedding of inversion

Purpose:

SET Trivium preserves covenantal truth

Exposes and corrects inverted structures embedded in culture, history, and language

Provides operational framework for Scripture study, internal witness, and external application

4. Summary

Grammar forms truth, Logic secures truth, Rhetoric bears truth — together constituting the Scriptural English Trivium (SET).

Next Steps / To Do:

Diagram the A → V → Z flow with seed, naming, and covenant planes visually

Provide canonical Scripture examples illustrating each plane in operation

Document use-cases for internal witness alignment and inverted seed detection
