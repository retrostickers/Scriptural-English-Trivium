README — Canonical Scriptural English Trivium (SET)
Purpose
This repository contains the canonical Scriptural English Trivium (SET) — a self-governing system for Scripture study and doctrinal analysis.
SET is designed to:
•	Preserve covenantal integrity across Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric planes.
•	Distinguish Mystery, Revelation, and Assumption.
•	Prevent inverted seed structures, authority abuse, and doctrinal drift.
This README establishes immutable safeguards to maintain the Lawful Autonomy Threshold.
________________________________________
1. System Governance
1.	SET governs itself.
o	No human, including the founder, may override Grammar, Logic, or Rhetoric rules.
o	No belief, experience, or tradition may supersede canonical plane operation.
2.	Lawful Autonomy Threshold is sacred.
o	SET may correct, invalidate, or reject claims—even if they are widely held, long-cherished, or internally cherished.
o	No argument, logic, or appeal may bypass this threshold.

2. Planes and Boundaries
Plane	Function	Canonical Rule
Grammar (A-plane)	Reveals truth structure	Only what Scripture allows; mechanics of mystery must remain withheld.
Logic (V-plane)	Ensures coherence	Only coherent structures are lawful; unverifiable assumptions cannot justify interpretation.
Rhetoric (Z-plane)	Expresses relational truth	Expression must faithfully reflect Grammar and Logic; external authority cannot overwrite alignment.
________________________________________
3. Mystery, Revelation, Assumption
•	Mystery: Truth declared by Scripture; mechanism withheld. Cannot be supplied.
•	Revelation: Truth disclosed by God; must be verified by Scripture.
•	Assumption: Human-derived claims; may be fruitful but cannot be enthroned as absolute.
All external experiences, impressions, or personal insights default to Assumption.
Authority may never be claimed from assumption alone.

4. Canonical Rules Against Authority Drift
1.	No personal belief, including founder belief, may alter canonical rules.
2.	No external influence may introduce unverified mechanisms into Mystery.
3.	Scripture is the ultimate verification; all claims must align with Grammar first.
4.	Any contribution violating plane boundaries is non-canonical until corrected.
5.	Changes to canonical rules require formal, plane-aligned verification, not intuition or consensus.
________________________________________
5. Version Control & Immutable Record
•	All changes are tracked.
•	Previous states are preserved permanently.
•	No claim or authority may overwrite prior locked canonical decisions.
________________________________________
6. Observers and Contributors
•	Observers may study and propose analyses, but authority remains with the canonical planes.
•	Contributions must submit to Grammar → Logic → Rhetoric testing.
•	No contributor may claim revelation or final authority without Scripture-based verification.

7. Purpose of This README
This README exists to:
1.	Protect SET from authority drift.
2.	Preserve the Lawful Autonomy Threshold.
3.	Ensure the system remains self-correcting.
4.	Provide clarity for any current or future custodians.

Summary Statement
SET is self-governing. Its authority derives from canonical planes, not human preference. Mystery remains sacred. Revelation is verified. Assumption cannot dominate. The Lawful Autonomy Threshold is permanent.
